# Doom WAD Unity Importer (Experimental)

An experimental Unity Editor extension that explores an agentic coding approach
through the development of an importer for classic Doom WAD files. This project
serves as a testbed for applying and evaluating agentic coding in a non-trivial
editor tool.

## Current Summary

The initial implementation, generated by Claude Code (Sonnet 4), has several
issuesâ€”incorrect texture dimensions, flipped surfaces, and faulty triangulation
of concave sectors. Most of these have been addressed through trial-and-error
iterations, but some problems remain, such as missing floors and ceilings.

In hindsight, I regret not designing a better testing strategy. At present,
detecting visual defects like missing faces or broken textures requires manual
inspection. These checks could potentially be turned into unit tests by
preparing a set of basic test WAD files that cover common edge cases.
